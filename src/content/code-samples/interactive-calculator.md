Occasionally, large corporations need to restructure their policies and few restructurings require better communication than a change in wages. One of the ways we chose to demonstrate the benefits of these new policies was to map out, via interactive calculator, how much more money the employees would be making. Moreover, how much money theyÂ _could_ have been making if the proposal was quickly accepted.

You can play with the calculator and see the source code on [this CodePen Project](https://codepen.io/xace90/project/editor/AOyxev/).
