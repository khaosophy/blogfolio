# Section Heading Anchors in Astro

If you spend much time on the web reading blogs or documentation, you may have encountered a little *link* icon next to a header. If you click on it, it will "anchor" to that section, meaning it will scroll to it and update the URL. It's a great way to share a specific section of a page with someone else. For example, maybe you're reading up [on Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components), and you want to link a coworker specifically to [the section on "Slots,"](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#slots) Astro gives you the ability to do that! Just click on the link icon, copy the updated URL, and share. In order to accomplish this in your own project, you need two things:

1. Something needs to have a unique ID, typically a header
2. You need something for the user to click to update the URL

In this post, I will walk you through how to set it up in an Astro project.
